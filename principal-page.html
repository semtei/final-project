					<p> I want to start with a small introduction to what galaxy superclusters are and how they inspired me to create this project. A galaxy supercluster is a large group of smaller galaxy clusters which is among the largest-known structures of the cosmos. The Milky Way is part of the Laniakea Supercluster, a supercluster that spans over 500 million light-years. The number of superclusters in the observable universe is estimated to be 10 million.</p>

					<p>10 million. Vast. Awe-inspiring. It is hard to think about these things and not feel like a speck of dust, or something even smaller. Insignificant. Invisible. Distances, magnitudes and values that we simply can’t dream about comprehending. As Carl Sagan said: “Our planet is a lonely speck in the great enveloping cosmic dark.” However, I think that it is extremely important to think about these things. </p>

					<p>In my experience, it is through knowledge and through meditating on these subjects that the speck of dust becomes a supercluster. Curiosity. Open-mindedness. Cultivation of the intellectual part of your being. Questioning reality. There are so many things to learn and read about, so many theories and ideas, philosophies and teachings, questions with no clear answer.</p>

					<p>I created this website because I wanted a place where these things could be discussed. I wanted to share the things that have inspired, awakened, motivated, and humbled me. Below you will find 25 supercluster names. By clicking on a supercluster, you will be taken to a new page where you will find something that I hope you find interesting, thought-provoking or inspiring. </p> 

					<p>In the first column, you will find concept definitions. In the second column, you will find theories about reality. In the thrid column, you will find a collection of quotes by different insipiring people. In the fourth column, you will find a series of videos. In the fifth and final column, you will find philosophical paradoxes. The idea is for you to comment with additional information, your points of view, your personal interpretations, similar interesting things that you have found, or anything that you feel like commenting. </p>
