				<p> Jivanmukta is someone who, in the Advaita Vedanta philosophy of Hinduism, has gained and assimilated self-knowledge, thus is liberated with an inner sense of freedom while living.</p>

				<p>The various texts and schools of Hinduism describe Jivanmukti state of existence as one of liberation and freedom reached within one’s life. Jivanmukti is a state that transforms the nature, attributes and behaviors of an individual, claim these ancient texts of Hindu philosophy. For example, according to Naradaparivrajaka Upanishad, the liberated individual shows attributes such as:</p>

				<ul>	
					<li>he is not bothered by disrespect and endures cruel words, treats others with respect regardless of how others treat him; </li>
					<li>when confronted by an angry person he does not return anger, instead replies with soft and kind words;</li>
					<li>even if tortured, he speaks and trusts the truth;</li>
					<li>he does not crave for blessings or expect praise from others;</li>
					<li>he never injures or harms any life or being (ahimsa), he is intent in the welfare of all beings;</li>
					<li>he is as comfortable being alone as in the presence of others;</li>
					<li>he is as comfortable with a bowl, at the foot of a tree in tattered robe without help, as when he is in a mithuna (union of mendicants), grama (village) and nagara (city);</li>
					<li>he doesn’t care about or wear sikha (tuft of hair on the back of head for religious reasons), nor the holy thread across his body. To him, knowledge is sikha, knowledge is the holy thread, knowledge alone is supreme. Outer appearances and rituals do not matter to him, only knowledge matters;</li>
					<li>for him there is no invocation nor dismissal of deities, no mantra nor non-mantra, no prostrations nor worship of gods, goddess or ancestors, nothing other than knowledge of Self;</li>
					<li>he is humble, high spirited, of clear and steady mind, straightforward, compassionate, patient, indifferent, courageous, speaks firmly and with sweet words.</li>
