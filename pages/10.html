				<p> The ship of Theseus, also known as Theseus's paradox, is a thought experiment that raises the question of whether an object that has had all of its components replaced remains fundamentally the same object. The paradox is most notably recorded by Plutarch in Life of Theseus from the late first century. Plutarch asked whether a ship that had been restored by replacing every single wooden part remained the same ship. </p>

				<p> Philosophers are perhaps not interested in the "Ship of Theseus" problem per se, but in a more general problem: How does one decide that X is the same as Y, where X describes something at one time, and Y describes that "same" thing at a later time? This is called the "problem of identity over time", or alternatively, the "problem of change". </p>
