				<p> N,N-Dimethyltryptamine (DMT or N,N-DMT) is a neurotransmitter and tryptamine molecule which naturally occurs in many plants, and is found within the pineal gland of mammals. It has been labeled the "spirit molecule" due to its suspected role in the induction of dreaming, near death experiences, and vivid visionary states which may be linked to mystical or religious experiences. It can be consumed as a powerful psychedelic drug, historically prepared by various cultures for ritualistic and healing purposes.</p>

				<p>DMT has a relatively short duration of action, intense effects and rapid onset. DMT can produce vivid mystical experiences involving euphoria and dynamic hallucinations of geometric forms, higher intelligences, extraterrestrials, elves and God. It can induce a state or feeling to a person that he or she is able to "communicate with other intelligent-life forms". High doses of DMT produce a hallucinatory state that involves sense of "another intelligence" that people sometimes describe as "super-intelligent", but "emotionally detached".</p>
