				<h3> A selection of quotes </h3>

				<ul id="quotes">

					<li>“If you would be a real seeker after truth, it is necessary that at least once in your life you doubt, as far as possible, all things.”</li>

					<li> “Doubt is the origin of wisdom.”</li>

					<li> “The senses deceive from time to time, and it is prudent never to trust wholly those who have deceived us even once.” </li>

					<li> “I suppose therefore that all things I see are illusions; I believe that nothing has ever existed of everything my lying memory tells me. I think I have no senses. I believe that body, shape, extension, motion, location are functions. What is there then that can be taken as true? Perhaps only this one thing, that nothing at all is certain.” </li>

					<li> “To live without philosophizing is in truth the same as keeping the eyes closed without attempting to open them.” </li>
