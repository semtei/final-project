				<h3> A selection of quotes </h3>

				<ul id="quotes">

					<li>"Life is a series of natural and spontaneous changes. Don't resist them; that only creates sorrow. Let reality be reality. Let things flow naturally forward in whatever way they like."</li>

					<li> “At the center of your being you have the answer; you know who you are and you know what you want.” </li>

					<li> "To attain knowledge, add things everyday. To attain wisdom, remove things every day."</li>

					<li> “If you realize that all things change, there is nothing you will try to hold on to. If you are not afraid of dying, there is nothing you cannot achieve.” </li>

					<li> “Where the mystery is the deepest is the gate of all that is subtle and wonderful.” </li>
